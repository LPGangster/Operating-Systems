## Task No. 02: Write a program that creates a child process using fork (). Parent sends a
message using Pipe () to the Child. The Child receives and displays the
message. Hint: To allow one way communication each process should close
one end of the pipe. The file Descriptors associated with a pipe can be closed
with the close (fd) system call. Output should be of this form:
Parent: I am Parent I have sent message to the Child
Child: I have received this message from parent: .......................
